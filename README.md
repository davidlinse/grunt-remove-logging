### Grunt-Remove-Logging (0.0.1)

Removes `console` related statements from JavaScript code by AST modification and code re-generation.

_Note:_
This module is at verry early stage of development and currently not a `npm` module.

In the current version it can be used as `pre-minify` task when all code is compressed/mini-/uglified anyway afterwards.

Code is re-generated by `escodegen` module so _ALL_ custom formatting is lost in the process.

A re-formatting of generated code is _left out by intend_ to avoid possible 'noise' about it's style.
The generated code is formated with the _default_ `format` options of `escodegen`.


#### Usage

```
$ git clone grunt-remove-logging
$ cd /to/your/project
$ npm install /path/to/grunt-remove-logging --save-dev
```

```
// Gruntfile.js
grunt.initConfig({
    'remove-logging': {
        files: {
            src: ['lib/**/*.js'],
            dest: 'dist/'
        }
    }
});

// as long as not an 'npm' module
// and/or during development
//
// grunt.loadTasks('./tasks');

// use it
grunt.registerTask('default', ['remove-logging', 'concat', 'uglify' /* more here */]);
```

```
#!/bin/sh
$ grunt remove-logging
```
